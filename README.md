Pegs in PuzzleScript
====================

The game Pegs for the TI-83+ graphing calculator, ported to the [PuzzleScript engine](http://www.puzzlescript.net/) for the browser.

[The original Pegs](http://www.detachedsolutions.com/puzzpack/pegs.php) was part of PuzzPack by Detached Solutions, and its main developer was Fred Coughlin. This port is by [Rory Oâ€™Kane](http://roryokane.com/).
